From 2019 until 2023, I was an active member of [SimDemocracy](https://reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/), an online simulated democracy of over 5,000 people.

I have held a variety of political offices on SimDemocracy: Economic Councilor, Economic Supervisor, Presidential Advisor, Treasury Secretary, etc.
I'm currently the Deputy Election Commissioner, which means that I organize elections when the main Election Commissioner cannot do so.

I also made some things that help keep SimDemocracy running:
  * I'm the primary author and maintainer of SimDemocracy's [economy bot](https://github.com/jonathanvdc/taubot), which manages the community's virtual currency.
  * I'm the author and maintainer of SimDemocracy's [voting website](http://simdemocracy.cf/).
    We use this website to set up elections, let citizens cast their ballots, and then tally the ballots.
    The website's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jonathanvdc/res-publica).
