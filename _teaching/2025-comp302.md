I was a TA for [COMP 302 Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2025-2026/courses/comp-302) at McGill University.
COMP 302 is a course in functional programming that introduces students to higher-order functions, type systems, and programming language design through OCaml.

In Fall 2025, I held office hours and served as a lab facilitator, leading OCaml labs. My responsibilities included:

* Designing and delivering lab sessions on topics such as higher-order functions, mutable state, object-oriented OCaml, and metaprogramming through partial evaluation.
* Creating clear and engaging exercises, lecture-style slides, and model solutions to help students grasp functional programming patterns and language semantics.
* Providing one-on-one and group support through office hours, emphasizing conceptual understanding over rote debugging.
* Grading assignments and exams, ensuring consistency and constructive feedback.

Beyond the formal teaching duties, I contributed to the pedagogical structure of the labs by revising explanations, improving pacing, and integrating visual examples for students new to OCaml.
This experience also deepened my own understanding of programming language theory and the art of communicating abstract ideas.
