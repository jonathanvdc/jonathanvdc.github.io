I have served as a Teaching Assistant for [ECSE 324 Computer Organization](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/ecse-324) at McGill University across multiple terms (Fall 2020, Fall 2022, and Fall 2023).

ECSE 324 is an introductory course on computer architecture and organization that explores basic computer structures, instruction set architectures, assembly language programming, input/output mechanisms, memory systems, software–hardware interaction, and processor implementation, with lab work involving assembly-level programming on single-board ARMv7 computers.

Across these TA appointments, my responsibilities included:
  * Designing and teaching assembly programming labs that reinforced core architectural concepts.
  * Running tutorials and demo sessions where students presented and demonstrated projects.
  * Grading student work and providing feedback on both conceptual and implementation challenges.
  * Supporting students in understanding how high-level programs map to low-level machine behavior.

Repeated involvement in this course allowed me to contribute at a deeper level over time, refining lab material, anticipating common student difficulties, and supporting learners in making the conceptual jump from abstract architectural models to concrete low-level implementations.
