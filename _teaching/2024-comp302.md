I have served as a Teaching Assistant for [COMP 302 Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2025-2026/courses/comp-302) at McGill University across multiple terms (Fall 2024 and Fall 2025).

COMP 302 is a core course in functional programming that introduces students to higher-order functions, type systems, and programming language design through extensive use of OCaml.

Across these appointments, my responsibilities included:
  - Holding regular office hours and providing conceptual support on functional programming and language semantics.
  - Designing and delivering OCaml lab sessions covering topics such as higher-order functions, mutable state, object-oriented OCaml, and metaprogramming via partial evaluation.
  - Creating exercises, lecture-style slides, and model solutions to support students new to functional programming.
  - Managing and evaluating student project work, as well as grading assignments and exams with an emphasis on clear, constructive feedback.

I contributed to the pedagogical structure of the labs by revising explanations, improving pacing, and integrating visual examples for students new to OCaml.
This experience also deepened my own understanding of programming language theory and the art of communicating abstract ideas.
