[Professor Els Laenens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/els-laenens/) hired me to create exercises and exam questions for the University of Antwerp's [course](https://www.uantwerpen.be/popup/opleidingsonderdeel.aspx?catalognr=1001WETTAL&taal=en&aj=2015) on regular languages and finite automata.
These exercises and exam questions were mostly related to mechanical applications of algorithms that students would have to perform by hand.
To ensure that the exercises would be appropriately challenging, I wrote a computer program that generated regular languages/finite automata.
The exercise generator automatically assessed how much effort it would take to apply the algorithms specified by the exercises.
