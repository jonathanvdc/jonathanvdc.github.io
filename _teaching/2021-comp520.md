During the Winter 2021 term, I TAed for the first time for [COMP 520 Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-520).
COMP 520 at McGill evaluated students entirely based on their coursework, which consisted of a sequence of assignments that eventually result in a complete compiler for a subset of the C programming language.

My responsibilities as a TA were to hold frequent office hours, update the auto-marker used to grade students' assignments, and preside over demo sessions.
Demo sessions were primarily designed to verify that students had a good understanding of how their solutions worked.
