I served as a Teaching Assistant for [COMP 520 Compiler Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2025-2026/courses/comp-520) at McGill University across multiple terms (Winter 2021, Winter 2022, Winter 2024, and Winter 2026).

COMP 520 is an advanced undergraduate/graduate-level course in compiler construction.
The course evaluates students entirely through coursework, consisting of a sequence of progressively more complex assignments that culminate in a complete compiler for a substantial subset of the C programming language.

Across these appointments, my responsibilities have included:
  * Holding regular office hours and providing in-depth technical guidance on compiler concepts and implementations.
  * Maintaining and extending the course auto-marker used to grade student assignments.
  * Presiding over demo sessions designed to assess students’ understanding of their implementations and design decisions.

Having TAed the course repeatedly, I am familiar with its structure, tooling, and pedagogical goals, and I regularly supported students with both conceptual questions (e.g., IR design, optimization passes) and low-level implementation challenges.
