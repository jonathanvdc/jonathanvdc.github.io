I have served as a Teaching Assistant for [COMP 303 Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-303) at McGill University across multiple terms (Fall 2020 and Fall 2021).

COMP 303 is a core undergraduate course focused on principles, mechanisms, techniques, and tools for object-oriented software design and its implementation, emphasizing concepts such as encapsulation, design patterns, and unit testing to build maintainable, high-quality software systems.

Across these appointments, my responsibilities included:
  * Assisting student groups with collaborative design challenges and project work.
  * Grading assignments and providing detailed feedback on software design and implementation.
  * Supporting students in understanding core concepts like object-oriented principles, design pattern usage, and unit testing.

Through repeated involvement in this course, I became familiar with its structure and pedagogical goals, and regularly helped students overcome conceptual and practical challenges in their software design projects.
