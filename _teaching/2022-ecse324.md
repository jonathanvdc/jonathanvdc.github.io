During the Fall 2022 semester, I returned as a TA for [ECSE 324 Computer Organization](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/ecse-324).
My responsibilities were similar to the ones I had two years prior: I designed and taught labs and tutorials.
I also presided over demo sessions where students presented their work and were graded based on that work.
