I presented my early research on robust program specialization at [CDP 2022](https://cdp-workshop.github.io/CDP22/), co-located with the 32nd International Conference on Collaborative Advances in Software and Computing (CASCON).
The project explored how equality saturation can be used to automatically derive accelerator-tailored program variants from high-level functional array code.

Specialized accelerators such as BLAS libraries and domain-specific hardware can significantly speed up computations, but programs that rely on them often lose portability. My talk addressed this challenge by showing how equality saturation can recognize idioms in purely functional code and robustly rewrite them to match accelerator APIs.
The approach combined general-purpose rewrite rules with accelerator-specific ones, enabling the system to rearrange program logic until accelerator patterns emerged. A key contribution was introducing the build and ifold operators, which provided a concise way to express loops and array traversals in the intermediate representation.

As a concrete case study, I demonstrated how our method successfully identified matrix operations (dot products, gemv, gemm) in the PolyBench benchmark suite and automatically rewrote them into BLAS calls. The results showed high coverage, with benchmarks like 1mm and slim-2mm achieving close to 100% idiom recognition.
