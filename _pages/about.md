I'm a PhD student at [McGill University's](https://www.mcgill.ca/) [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/).
My supervisor is the one and only [Christophe Dubach](https://cdubach.bitbucket.io). I am also affiliated with [Mila](https://mila.quebec).

My research interests include optimizing compilers and the application of reinforcement learning (RL), graph neural networks (GNNs), formal verification, and counter-example inductive synthesis (CEGIS) thereto.
My thesis topic is to reimagine optimizing compilers from scratch to quickly generate excellent code for complex hardware such as accelerators.
I think that all of the aforementioned technologies (RL, GNNs, formal verification, CEGIS) will play a part in helping accomplish that goal.
